Jukebox
Let’s recap what you discovered today about the Structured Query Language. We will start from a database called Jukebox with some information about Artists and Tracks (like Spotify has).

Map the tables on the Database Schema
Write the SQL queries to answer these questions:
List all artists (only names)
Count the number of tracks that are shorter than 2 minutes
List the first ten albums of the Jukebox DB, sorted alphabetically

Jukebox Advanced
Let’s take a look at the Jukebox database again and write two queries to:

List the track and album information for the tracks which names are containing a given keyword (case insensitive)
List the top 5 Rock artists with the most tracks
